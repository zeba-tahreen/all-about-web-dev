# All about Web Development

## MindSet

*This Project will be close to me as I personally wish if there was a guidance like this at the beginning of 
my journey to become a "Web Developer". This web app does not have any __Lectures__ or __Excercises__, this is 
a basic knowledge a person needs to start or make up their mind to where they want to go, what is the path line 
and what is the trend stacks in the market.*

*Most of the information I will be getting here is purely based on __Google__ search and __Wikipedia__, as I am 
trying to make this crystal clear not to be manipulated for an easy start.*

## Project Details

In this web app "All about Web Development", I will try to grab as much as possible knowledge on topics like
* Types of languages that exits in coding.
* What is Full stack and types of stacks?
* What is Front-end and what is Back-end?
* What educational qualification you need to be a web developer?
* __Many more...__
